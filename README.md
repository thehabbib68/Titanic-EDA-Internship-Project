# Titanic EDA Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset as part of my **internship at BiStartX**.  
The goal was to analyze survival patterns, identify correlations, and visualize key insights.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Women & Children had higher survival rates**.
- **First-class passengers had better chances** of survival.
- **Higher fares correlated with better survival probability**.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Data/` → Raw and cleaned Titanic dataset.
- `images/` → Saved visualizations from analysis.
- `Notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook with EDA..
- `Basic Data Analysis` → project report.
